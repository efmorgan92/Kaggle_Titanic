# Kaggle Competition: 
## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
Instead of learning through textbook examples, I decided to practice with Kaggle competitions! I am working through "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R"; however, I am attemping to put my knowledge to use through Kaggle rather than the standard examples in the book. 

The attached files include various analyses of Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Competition. The goal of this work is to gain experience using a number of statistical methods, and evaluate their performance against one another within this particular competition. 

Given the goal of the competition (predict the survival of specific members onboard the Titanic), I'll be using methods best suited for qualitative/categorical outcomes. R scripts, success rates, visualizations and anything else I find will be posted here as I work through the rest of the book.
